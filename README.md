Bank Queue Simulation
This project simulates the queue management system at a bank's service counters using Java. It aims to optimize customer service and reduce waiting times.

Features
Queue Management: Simulates customer queues at multiple service counters.
Customer Handling: Manages customer arrival, service time, and waiting time.
Performance Analysis: Provides insights into queue efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Project Structure
Queue Data Structure: Implements a FIFO queue using Java's LinkedList.
Customer Class: Represents a customer with attributes like arrival time, service time, and start time.
ServiceCounter Class: Manages individual service counters, queue length, and total service time.
BankSimulation Class: Controls the simulation, including customer assignment to counters and overall performance metrics.
How to Run
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-queue-simulation.git
cd bank-queue-simulation
Compile the Code:

javac BankSimulation.java
Run the Simulation:

java BankSimulation
Input Parameters:

Number of service counters
Number of customers
Time each customer will take at the counter
Rate of customer arrival at the bank (in minutes)
Example
Enter number of service counters: 2
Enter number of customers: 5
Enter time each customer will take at the counter: 4
Enter rate of customer arrival at the bank (in minutes): 2
Output
The simulation will output the total time taken to serve all customers, the number of customers served by each counter, and the average service time per customer.
